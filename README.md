# WhatsAppGroupTag

This repo is a script file that will tag all members of a group at one go. (currently needs fixing) using whatsapp web in JS

<h2>Current workings: </h2>

<ul>
<li>Use "tester" and it will work with everyone</li>

<li>"Use fdOn" then type "Create". ---> this makes the bot ask you to create a label group make sure to answer correctly to the props on your group chat</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixes:</h2>

Needed to move from local object storage to file storage of labels per Group:

Plan on doing this using a file entry of JSON objects using the JSON parser
